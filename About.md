According to [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unconference): 
> An unconference is a facilitated, participant-driven conference centered on a theme or purpose.

It is within this context that a Ottawa Accessibility Unconference will be held on Friday December 6th, 2014 with, as the name suggests, the theme centering on accessibilityâ€”namely, to information technology for people with disabilities.

The even will bring together developers, usability professionals, web designers, other IT professionals and end-users with disabilities together in an informal, non-threatening environment to learn from each other and to promote universal design of and accessibility to IT. As it is an unconference, speakers will be solicited on-site and the schedule will be built on the spot.

The idea of an accessibility unconference for Ottawa was first inspired by [@Jennison](http://twitter.com/jennison) and the work of people who have or are organizing unconferences on this subject around the world.

We could have called it Accessibility Camp Ottawa, but decided to go for more of an unconference format.
